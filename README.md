# Note App

<img width="1146" alt="demo" src="./src/assets/demo.png">

This is a note-taking app powered by React. Additionally, we use TailwindCSS as a CSS framework.

Of course, there are many note-taking apps on GitHub, so the goal is not just to create another note app, but rather to leverage React 18 and its powerful hooks and other features. Please refer to the source code for more details.

Since this application does not have a database, we are using LocalStorage to save the notes. Therefore, please avoid storing any important data on this application.
